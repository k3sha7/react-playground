## React Playground
My React playground: a sandbox for exploring cool ideas and quick prototypes.

__[Styled Modal](https://react-playground-k.vercel.app/modal)__ - customizable modal component using react portal with the help of tailwind and headless-ui, also a try to connect with your meta mask account. Inspired from [Walletconnect](https://docs.walletconnect.com/)    

__[Dev finder](https://react-playground-k.vercel.app/dev-finder)__ - search for GitHub user's info with the help of GitHub's public API, a challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6)

__[Terrified Morty](https://react-playground-k.vercel.app/terrified-morty)__ - Morty rotates his eyes based on the mouse cursor, inspired by [PocketBase's](https://pocketbase.io/) UI

__[Live shapes](https://react-playground-k.vercel.app/shapes)__ - cool looking shapes moving around seems simple, but really is not, instructed by [Hyperlexed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhfQnmGXSwU&t=75s)
