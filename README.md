####Cool UI

- [Terrified Morty](react-playground-k.vercel.app/terrified-morty) - morty rotates his eyes based on the mouse cursor, inspired from [PocketBase's](https://pocketbase.io/) UI
- [Live shapes](react-playground-k.vercel.app/shapes) - cool locking shapes moving around seems simple but really is not, instructed by [Hyperlexed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhfQnmGXSwU&t=75s)
